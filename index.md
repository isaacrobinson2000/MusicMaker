Discover how our modern-day digital devices produce sound, 
by using Arduino’s to create your very own musical instruments!
 Once created, you'll compose musical tunes on your instruments, 
which will be showcased at the end in the form of a music and lights show!

### Class Goals:

 - Learn what sound is, and how it can be converted into electrical signals for digital storage and playback.
 - Construct electronic circuits capable of taking sound samples from an Arduino and driving a speaker using them.
 - Learn some of the fundamentals of music and utilize this to compose simple tunes that can be played back utilizing their Arduino instruments.

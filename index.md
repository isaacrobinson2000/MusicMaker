Discover how our modern-day digital devices produce sound, 
by using Arduinoâ€™s to create your very own musical instruments!
 Once created, you'll compose musical tunes on your instruments, 
which will be showcased at the end in the form of a music and lights show!

### Class Goals:

 - Learn what sound is, and how it can be converted into electrical signals for digital storage and playback.
 - Construct electronic circuits capable of taking sound samples from an Arduino and driving a speaker using them.
 - Learn some of the fundamentals of music and utilize this to compose simple tunes that can be played back utilizing their Arduino instruments.
